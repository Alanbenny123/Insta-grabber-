# Instagram Grabber(Instagram Video Downloader)

This project is an educational demonstration of building a web application to
download Instagram videos using Next.js. The primary goal is to explore modern
web development techniques, including server-side rendering/components, API
interaction (potentially via Next.js API routes), state management, form
handling, and building a clean UI with Shadcn/ui.

videos from Instagram may violate their Terms of Service. Please respect
